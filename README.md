I have features that I was going to add, but I don't have time to do it.
So you can send me a pull request with them.

A game about a cheerful astronaut who jumps on space debris inside the event horizon and gets out of it
You need to click the mouse, aim and jump

BACKLOG:

IMPLEMENTED:
- To jump in place, you need to click on your planet. Sometimes this will help out when you need to jump over space debris
- To grow, you need to eat astronaut food
- The larger the hero becomes, the slower he moves
- Level editor (config file is enough)
- Attack of space spiders. Sometimes, instead of planets, you will come across a spider web. If you get stuck in it and cannot get out, then a spider will attack. And from our point of view. That is, the camera will grow mandibles and it will approach the Cosmo boy
- There will be a progression from a minimalist astronaut to a mega pumped up one and in the end he will burst from his pumping
- The astronaut's size should represent 5 stages of age (childhood, adolescence, youth, maturity and old age)
- Phase change: similar to how insects grow from pupae. The astronaut is bursting from the inside and he bursts, throwing off the old wrapper. This can also be shown as when receiving dismorality in darkest dungeon
- When picking up special food, an animation in the spirit of SpongeBob is played, when they show close-up realistic body horror pictures of a man brutally eating a space eater, squeezing tubes into himself with rage and force
- If you repaint the webs black gradually, you will get a horror effect

ARCHIVE:
- The player's position on the asteroid determines how fast he will jump. At the top - neutral, further from the target asteroid - slower, closer - faster
- If you hold down the jump button, you can adjust the shape of the trajectory arc
- When hitting the edge of the map, the accumulated food will fly out of the player (free jump implementation is needed)
- Powerup: Double jump, if you press the jump again during the jump. This extends the normal jump
- Sometimes you will encounter comets, when jumping from which, the astronaut will begin to rotate. They are shown with a crack in the middle and fall apart after the jump
- Copying an object in the editor
- Some meteorites will be at the top of the screen, in order to stick to them you need to make a turn,
- And sometimes you need to specifically push off from the stones to get on the right trajectory (eg for resources)
- To turn, you need a spaceman
- There will be flat rotating platforms, and the food on them will be only on one side, so you can jump accurately
- Complications for those rotating - a centrifuge that rotates very quickly
- The speed of the death animation increases with frequent deaths
- Space debris interferes with the player
- When hitting space debris, the accumulated food will fly out
- Space debris is a fine suspension of fragments and dust, has a long extension and a brownish-green appearance of fog. Moves from right to left. Does not allow the player to pass, deals damage
- Twist: at the end of the universe's life, only black holes remain
- Sometimes you will come across a rocket. It will allow you to fly a significant distance and you can maneuver on it. But you can't crash into it
- Additional tool "spray" to paint space and leave bunches of dust
- When clicking on an asteroid that is inaccessible - play an animation *shrugs*
- Poster in the game menu: a small astronaut sits in the arms of a large one, and several more small astronauts are hidden behind (like in the painting "Unequal Marriage")
- animation of the camera approaching and darkening the screen when falling into a web
- By clicking on the shift key, you can try on the maximum allowable distance in the editor. It depends on the level
